{:class='tabletoc'}

**The Final Score**. This finale is a challenging, two-part heist. You may attempt it at any time. We recommend a fully Pro team.

## Factions

**Fence Cartel**. A bunch of snooty academics, this collective can really help you make money moving merchandise like artwork and jewelry.

**Corrupt Cops**. For when you need guards or get busted.

**Hacker Collective**. Experts at cameras and information.

**Mafia**. They're people people. And they've been doing this a lot longer us.

*Remember:* most Fixers only work with others in their faction for a given heist. However, you can still be introduced to Fixers of multiple factions across the campaign.

# County Jail

If a character is busted, you may simply build a new Amateur character. Alternatively, your team my opt to rescue you. Even if the entire team is busted, you may opt for a breakout using these rules.

---

**Breakout Rule**. No limit on the number of characters on entrances. However, each character must leave out a different exit. If they do not, all characters are Busted.

**Help from Outside**. Busted characters must start inside the jail. Non-Busted characters must start outside of the jail.

**Rehabilitated?** Characters who started the breakout Busted may level up if they escape. Characters who started the breakout Non-Busted do not level up.

**Pick Your Moment**. Your team may choose which opportunity is appropriate. The more difficult the job, the more profitable it is.

# The Final Score

<div class="handwriting">
Lots of moving pieces on this one. You're gonna need a breather halfway through to regroup and adjust your plans. Sorry but this one is out of my league.
</div>

This is a two-part heist. For the first part, you must start in the middle of the board and break out of all four doors. For the second heist, your characters keep their ideas and your team may discuss your plan for the next board.

Your **Old Friend** Fixer is not available for this heist.

If you have been introduced to (i.e. unlocked) two or more Fixers who can work with a given faction, you are considered a **friend** of that faction. Otherwise, you are an **enemy** of that faction. (Your Old Friend does not count.)

For each enemy faction, the following happens:

  * *Corrupt Cops*: add four Guard Dog tokens to the bag
  * *Hackers*: add a Watchtower to a certain corner
  * *Fence Cartel*: add a Reinforcement token in the southwest corner of the first map
  * *Mafia*: add a hostage to one of the unlocked gates. You must rescue this hostage

Fixers who you have not been introduced to will then turn on you and hurt you. If you don't use those fixers for THIS heist, you don't get their negative effect.
