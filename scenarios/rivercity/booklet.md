# Factions

<div class="handwriting">
You would discover this anyway, but I'll fill you in real quick.

-An Old Friend
</div>

**Fence Cartel**. A bunch of snooty academics, this collective can really help you make money moving merchandise like artwork and jewelry.

**Corrupt Cops**. You want these on your side when you get busted or handle some Guards.

**Hacker Collective**. Experts at cameras and information.

**Mafia**. They're people people, and they've been doing this a lot longer than we have.

*Remember:* most Fixer only work with others in their faction for a given heist. However, you can still be introduced to Fixers of multiple factions across the campaign.

# The Crown Jewels

# The Final Score

<div class="handwriting">
Lots of moving pieces on this one. You're gonna need a breather halfway through to regroup and adjust your plans. Sorry but this one is out of my league.
</div>

This is a two-part heist. For the first part, you must start in the middle of the board and break out of all four doors. For the second heist, your characters keep their ideas and your team may discuss your plan for the next board.

Your **Old Friend** Fixer is not available for this heist.

If you have been introduced two or more Fixers who can work with a faction, you are considered a **friend** of that faction. Otherwise, you are an **enemy** of that faction. (Your Old Friend does not count.)

For each enemy faction, the following happens:

  * *Corrupt Cops*: add four Guard Dog tokens to the bag
  * *Hackers*: add a Watchtower to a certain corner
  * *Fence Cartel*: add a Reinforcement token in the southwest corner of the first map
  * *Mafia*: add a hostage to one of the unlocked gates. You must rescue this hostage

Fixers who you have not been introduced to will then turn on you and hurt you. If you don't use those fixers for THIS heist, you don't get their negative effect.
