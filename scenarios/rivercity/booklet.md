# The Final Score

From your old friend:

> So you've decided to hit the world's largest gang huh? Nice.
{:.text-message}

> Lots of moving pieces on this one. Sorry but this one is out of my league.
{:.text-message}

 Your Old Friend Fixer **is not available** for either part of these heists, but other fixers may be used.

## Part 1: The Secrets

> Wait... you're gonna STAY in there hidden with all those government secrets?
{:.text-message}

You will be tunneling into a federal building to steal the government secrets from their vault, then hiding in the building itself. Once the alarm sounds for the first heist, your only escape locations are the hideouts (denoted by *).

When this heist is finished, you may now rebuild the board for the second heist, keeping the hexes with players on them on the table. Rebuild the security bag according to the new security token distributions.

## Part 2: A New Acquaintance

> You never know who you are going to meet once inside
{:.text-message}

 Once the alarms die down, make a break for it! Break out of all four doors by taking the Mayor hostage.

Plan for the additional heist by setting new planning tokens (you no longer need a planning token on your current location). You may not use Fixer abilities during this phase, but you may use Character powers that impact this phase.
