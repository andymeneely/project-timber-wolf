  * **Spread Out**. No limit on the number of characters on entrances. However, each character must leave out a different exit. If they do not, all characters are Busted.
  * **Break-in to Breakout**. Busted characters must start inside the jail. Non-Busted characters must start outside of the jail.

{:class="text-message"}

This is a two-part heist. For the first part, you must start in the middle of the board and break out of all four doors. For the second heist, your characters keep their ideas and your team may discuss your plan for the next board.

Your **Old Friend** Fixer is not available for this heist.

If you have been introduced to (i.e. unlocked) two or more Fixers who can work with a given faction, you are considered a **friend** of that faction. Otherwise, you are an **enemy** of that faction. (Your Old Friend does not count.)

For each enemy faction, the following happens:

  * *Corrupt Cops*: add four Guard Dog tokens to the bag
  * *Hackers*: add a Watchtower to a certain corner
  * *Fence Cartel*: add a Reinforcement token in the southwest corner of the first map
  * *Mafia*: add a hostage to one of the unlocked gates. You must rescue this hostage

Once the alarm sounds for the first heist, finish it as normal. You may now rebuild the board for the second heist, keeping the hexes with players on them on the table. Rebuild the security bag according to the new security token distributions.

Plan for the additional heist by setting new planning tokens (you no longer need a planning token on your current location). You may not use Fixer abilities during this phase, but you may use Character powers that impact this phase.

## NOTES
* Part 1: we're setting up a tunnel along the south hallway. You choose the entrypoint and send two people there. The other two must go through the west entrance.
* Part 1: this needs to look like a robbery. Steal at least $5k worth of money.
* Before Part 2: the two people who are on the same tile can share ideas with each other between heists.
