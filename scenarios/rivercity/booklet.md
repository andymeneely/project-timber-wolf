  * **Spread Out**. No limit on the number of characters on entrances. However, each character must leave out a different exit. If they do not, all characters are Busted.

# The Final Score

From your old friend:

> So you've decided to hit up the world's largest gang huh? Nice.
{:class="text-message"}

> Wait... you're gonna STAY in there hidden with all those government secrets?
{:class="text-message"}

> Lots of moving pieces on this one. Sorry but this one is out of my league.
{:class="text-message"}

This is a two-part heist.

  * Part 1. You will be stealing the government secrets from their vault, then hiding in the building itself.
  * Part 2. Once the alarms die down, make a break for it! Break out of all four doors.

Your **Old Friend** Fixer is not available for this heist.

Once the alarm sounds for the first heist, your only escape points are the hideouts*.  You may now rebuild the board for the second heist, keeping the hexes with players on them on the table. Rebuild the security bag according to the new security token distributions.

Plan for the additional heist by setting new planning tokens (you no longer need a planning token on your current location). You may not use Fixer abilities during this phase, but you may use Character powers that impact this phase.

Before Part 2: the two people who are on the same tile can share ideas with each other between heists.
