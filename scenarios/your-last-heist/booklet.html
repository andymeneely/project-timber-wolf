  <p><em>Your Last Heist:</em> <br />
The Campaign</p>
</div>

<p>This is the main campaign to take you through the world of <em>Your Last Heist</em>. The story is broken into three Acts. These are parallel stories that take place over seven days. The Acts are in increasing order of complexity and difficulty. Each Act has a unique narrator and a different suggested starting crew, but they are all part of one story.</p>

<p>Since the Acts occur in parallel, you may play the campaigns in parallel as well. This might be useful if you have multiple gaming groups playing the same game. To play these stories in parallel, you will need to open the envelopes of any chapter from a prior act. We also recommend that at least one person remain common between the teams.</p>

<p>The <strong>rebuilding scenarios</strong> may be played at any time, with any crew, have easy objectives and ample loot. Use these scenarios to rebuild your crew after a particularly rough outcome. Play them as often as you like.</p>

<p>Many scenarios also have a <strong>standalone challenge</strong>. These are reasonable conditions under which one could play the chapter directly without going through the entire campaign. Most standalone challenges involve varying crew compositions that might not otherwise be easily achievable using the suggested crew compositions. Standalone challenges are entirely optional and have no impact on your campaign.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy these campaigns! And I hope that you are inspired to make your own heist scenarios. Feel free to share your work over at yourlastheist.com</p>

<p>And now, it&#8217;s time to get started. Go ahead and open up the packet for Act I Chapter I.</p>

<p><em>The crew is chatting about how the prison had another breakout this morning.</em></p>

<p><em>The Fence calls a meeting at the safe house but isn&#8217;t there. A letter is sitting on a table next to the blueprints of The Gallery.</em></p>

<p><em>&#8220;Back along the way I had two friends who were the best in the business. They acquired, I sold. One day we had a customer who was bad news from the start. Tried to keep his money and run off with the goods. We got mixed up, and then it all went down. One of us escaped. I ended up in jail, whole. But my buddy Tat was not so lucky. The Collector took Tat&#8217;s pinkies with those psycho feds he has on his payroll.&#8221;</em></p>

<p><em>&#8220;When you were back at the Collector&#8217;s Estate, I did some poking around his house and came across my buddy&#8217;s &#8216;trophies&#8217;. I knew I found my guy.&#8221;</em></p>

<p><em>&#8220;It&#8217;s time for me to come clean with you. I busted you out and groomed you because I was looking for this Collector so we can hit him on the only thing he cares about: his collection.&#8221;</em></p>

<p><em>&#8220;There&#8217;s one thing that will drive this guy nuts: to see the real paintings sitting in a museum, so secure he can&#8217;t afford to get them. The Gallery has had two heists already, and it&#8217;s about get a third. <strong>Get these paintings back into the museum, in their rightful places</strong>. Unfortunately, security is a bit tighter this time around.&#8221;</em></p>

<p><em>A short, stocky, grim-faced man meets with some new recruits in his workshop.</em></p>

<p><em>&#8220;Nobody ever said this career was easy. You gotta keep moving, keep innovating. Get in, get out, get paid. Don&#8217;t get greedy. That&#8217;s what I learned from my last crew, and that is what I intend to teach all of you today.&#8221;</em></p>

<p><em>&#8220;They say that getting out is hardest part of any heist. Well, that&#8217;s where I come in. You see, I create exits where there are none. As a result of my abilities, however, marks that would otherwise be too risky for most crews become available. Only thing is&#8230; I&#8217;m a bit noisy&#8230; so just be ready to split when I hit the button.&#8221;</em></p>

Now I&#8217;m an accepting person of alternative beliefs, they&#8217;re using their &#8220;charities&#8221; as a front for money laundering. Fair game. These heists have no specific objectives - just get out whole and take as much as you can in preparation for the next heist.</em></p>
