SOMEWHERE we need to have the ability to create entrances at 2-3 pre-defined spaces. Like you tunnel in or something. Make it part of the planning phase

SOMEWHERE we should have a stack of ideas in the middle of the board. Help with escaping or something.

SOMEWHERE we should have heists where the jewels are the same size as the security chits - so we don't know where the jewels are until we do a lot of reveals. Make the security chits by the door be already open so you can't get too lucky

SOMWHERE we should have a set of stories with a couple of NPCs. The special events could involve prisoner panic, etc. It's more to manage but it could be considered a "hard" scenario because you're managing more things. Also: add more events to these because the prisoners get noisy. (Maybe this could be for the Veteran thing?)

SOMEWHERE we can take a hostage. He does lots of things for you until he panics and causes problems. Maybe steal a hostage who then becomes our ally in the next heist. So maybe he won't know us so it's not a bad thing that we're stealing him, and then the next time he's a more helpful. Then he helps us get more prisoners out and such. The whole campaign would be about getting together another crew.

The Fall Guys
=============
(3 heists)

Flagship storyline about a bunch of criminals who get in over their head

The Docks - all amateurs, can free a Prisoner
The Warehouse - all level up, pull off a huge heist
The Clink - break out of prison at the end and go your separate ways

The Venetian Swap
============================
(6-heists, medium difficulty)

The Fence - everyone breaks out of prison at once. Maybe have different players be locked in a Pressure Sensor and one player has to free them.

The Gallery - steal some paintings, classic need vs. greed.

The Provenance -  to fence the paintings properly, so we steal the provenance

The Collector - find out they are forgeries, so we steal original paintings from the Collector

The Incident - your fence gets revenge from The Collector and needs to be broken out of the Italian Embassy.

The Venetian Swap - But security is much stiffer now. Nobody can be busted and you have to clear a high payroll to succeed.

The Smugglers
=============
(2 heists, medium difficulty)
A storyline about the smugglers from The Fall Guys, and the competitors they have which show up in The Money Tree. They have a Tunneler with them to start with. Both the Smugglers and the Collector have run-ins with The Smuggler.

The Station - steal a couple of items and get out the other side. Gates close behind them.
The Compound - steal more stuff and get to the other side, with more pressure sensors. Gates close behind them again.

The Money Tree
==============
(2 heist, hard difficulty)
All about running around and stealing lots of things for The Forum. Money is usually the objective, with a few intricate coordinations along the way.

The Bank Job - amateur characters, lots of money everywhere and you have to decide on greed
The Vault Job - intricate pressure sensors and you have to really coordinate to get them

The Veteran
===========
(6 heists, hard difficulty)
All about learning from a veteran (aka The Collector) who pulls heists by himself. This one would have the death or betrayal of a character in the middle and you get a new character tree

The Collector - free a prisoner who offers to train you up
The University - get records
The Yacht - free another prisoner who gets you a new character tree
The Choice - must sacrifice a character
The Veteran
