The Venetian Swap
=================
The Gallery - steal some paintings
The Mansion - find out they are forgeries, so we steal original paintings from the forger
The Archives - need to fence the paintings properly, so we steal the provenance
The Embassy - the provenance involves someone from who knows something. Steal evidence and break someone out of the Embassy.
The Gallery - fence goes south, so we get hired break in to swap your originals with the gallery's. But security is much stiffer now. Nobody can be busted and you have to clear a high payroll to succeed.

The Smugglers
=============
A storyline about the smugglers from The Fall Guys, and the competitors they have which are known as The Forum.
