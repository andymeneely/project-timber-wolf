# Chapter 3. The Provenance

_Good news! I've got a buyer lined up. Here's the problem. He's a little squeamish about this particular collection. Says he needs documented proof that these are authentic. Now, unless one of you is forger, we're gonna need to acquire those provenance records from deep within the Gallery archives. Security is a little heavier down there - watch out for those pressure sensors and for the new long-range camera system they call Watchtower._

_**Your objective is to get both documents**. But, it also looks like the archives also have a set of jewels awaiting appraisal. If you bring back one jewel, I'll provide $3k. For both, I'll pay you $7k._

_Best of luck and don't get too greedy._

## Planning Phase

* EVENTS: Use Standard Events 1-21.
* SPECIAL EVENTS: Place two Watchtower Special Events on top of Events 10 and 16.
* You may purchase üí° for $1k each of your Team Cash and give it to any Character to start with
* You may purchase üîç for $1k each
* A maximum of two Characters may start on a given Entrance tile
* No maximum on the number of Characters per Escape tile

## Upon Success
_Excellent! I think this will be a good relationship. Here's
$6k for team loot, plus payout for extra jewels. At this point I'll let you
promote any non-Busted characters for $3k each and $2k for each Skill._

_Huh. That's funny. These records have some authentication facts about these
paintings. They don't match. We stole some fakes!! Ok let me do some
digging and figure what happened._

Change the painting tokens in your Team Loot to their fake counterparts.

Be sure to record the following on your Campaign ledger:
* Team Cash
* Team Loot
