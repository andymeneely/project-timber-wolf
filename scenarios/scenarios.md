# The Fall Guys

## Chapter 1. The Smuggler Tip

<img class="map" src="the fall guys ch 1 the docks.svg">

_Last week we caught wind of a big shipment of various stolen artifacts coming in from overseas. My buddy in customs would love to bust these guys the legal way, but he just found out his boss is working for these smugglers. Way I see it, we hit them at the transfer to prove ourselves as a new crew, my buddy gets paid for his tip but his nose stays clean, and maybe that leads us to a bigger job down the line. The shipment includes three paintings and a rare jewel. **Our objective is to steal the jewel and two paintings.** If we steal all three paintings, we can get an extra $2k to help out with our next job._

### Setup

* Events: Use Events 1-21
* Special Events: Place the Reinforcements card on top of Event 14.
* Team Cash starts at $0k

We suggest using these characters & skills:

* Angry Locksmith with Hit 'n' Run and Yank Wires
* Script Kiddie with Bypass and Hit 'n' Run
* Burglar with Wing It and Yank Wires

### Planning Phase

* A maximum of two Characters may start on a given Entrance tile

### Upon Success

_Well done! Unfortunately when I tried to fence that jewel my guy tipped off the Smugglers. Can't trust anyone in this business. I assume they were impressed by our work, otherwise we wouldn't be alive right now._

_I'm meeting up with the Smugglers tomorrow. For now, train
up and we'll see what's next. Don't wory, I can handle myself._

* Add $3k to the Team Cash.
* Add $2k to Team Cash if all three paintings were stolen.
* Everyone who is not busted, promote character and refine skills.

## Chapter 2. The Warehouse Job

<img class="map" src="the fall guys ch 2 the warehouse.svg">

_Met with the Smugglers. Sounds they were impressed by our little stunt. I was expecting retaliation, instead they're offering us some more work! Good to see our talents being appreciated._

_Here's the job. There's an abandoned warehouse that's used as a secure storage for a variety of stolen goods being moved by the competitors of the Smugglers, The Forum. Security is pretty intricate on this one. They've got a thermal imaging system called The Watchtower, plus some pressure sensors that makes our life complicated. **Our objective is to steal two jewels,** but if we get the third we get an extra $3k for our next job._

_Let's show them what we're made of._

# The Fall Guys

## Chapter 3. Your Last Heist

_Well folks, I guess those double-crossing smuggling bastards have the feds in their pockets, too. But when they got us pinched, they made some key mistakes. For one, they put us all in the same jail cell. For another, I still have our money._

_Time to bust out of here. **Our objective is to get out of this place, each to a different exit**, then, we go our separate ways and never speak of this fiasco again. God speed. And remember... you are only ever as good as your last heist._

# The Venetian Swap

## Chapter 1. The Fence

_Look around. You might see a bunch of lowlife criminals putting in their time, but me? I see a business opportunity. See, I've got a bunch of... connections. I know how to find people who are willing to purchase the world's greatest artwork with no questions asked. I simply lack the means of... acquisition. That's where you all come in. I've hand-picked this team for your talents and potential. First, let's get out of here._

_Our objective is to get me out of here. If some of you don't make it, we can find a replacement but I'd rather not have that happen. Now the only way to pull this off is to have a maximum of two characters at each exit. You may notice that our locksmith friend here is specially equipped to get this party started. But first, let's do a little recon._

## Chapter 2. The Gallery Job

<img class="map" src="venetian swap ch 2 the gallery.svg">

_Our first mark will be our friendly local art gallery. They're expecting a new exhibit of paintings coming in from Venice, Italy tomorrow. Gorgeous collection. Even the museum curators have underappreciated - and undervalued - this collection. Security is pretty lax but, just to be cautious, you cannot have more than two players per entrance to start with. Exit however you want, just make sure you remember those gates close when the alarm goes off._

_To make payroll, I just need three paintings. Now, you should know that these pieces will sell better if we have them in sets. Both fruit paintings will sell for an extra $2k and all three building portraits will get us an extra $4k. We can use any bonus money for the next job._

_Good luck and don't forget: getting in is the easy
part._

### Setup

_Excellent work! Wow these are even more beautiful in person. These'll sell for a pretty penny I'm sure. Now I'll go look for a potential buyer. While I'm gone, I want one of you to level up. One of you who actually stole a painting this heist is eligible. I'll let the team decide who gets this promotion._

* One non-Busted Character may be promoted

Be sure to record the following on your campaign history:

* Team Cash
* Which paintings you stole in Team Loot
* Characters who were busted
* Character Promotion

# The Venetian Swap

## Chapter 3. The Provenance

<img class="map" src="venetian swap ch 3 the archives.svg">

_Good news! I've got a buyer lined up. Here's the problem. He's a little squeamish about this particular collection. Says he needs documented proof that these are authentic. Now, unless one of you is forger, we're gonna need to acquire those provenance records from deep within the Gallery archives. Security is a little heavier down there - watch out for those pressure sensors and for the new long-range camera system they call Watchtower._

_**Your objective is to get both documents**. But, it also looks like the archives also have a set of jewels awaiting appraisal. If you bring back one jewel, I'll provide $3k. For both, I'll pay you $7k._

_Best of luck and don't get greedy._

_Excellent! I think this will be a good relationship. Here's
$4k for team loot, plus payout for extra jewels. At this point I'd be willing to support some "professional development"._

_Huh. That's funny. These records have some authentication facts about these
paintings. They don't match. We stole some fakes!! Ok let me do some
digging and figure what happened._

* Add $4k to your Team Cash, plus $3k/$7k if you stole 1/2 jewels.
* You may Promote non-Busted Characters for $3k each
* You may Refine the Skills of any non-Busted Character for $2k each

## Chapter 4. The Collector

<img class="map" src="venetian swap ch 4 the collector.svg">

_Turns out there's a bigger fan of these paintings than me. I have no idea who he hired for the job, but managed to beat us to the Gallery. He doesn't show up on the provenance, so he clearly didn't acquire these paintings legally. Let's liberate his collection. Plus, we might as well put these fakes to good use._

_**Your objective is to swap in at least three painting fakes we have and steal the authentic ones**. Don't steal anything we don't have a fake for. Any swaps beyond the three I'll give an extra $3k. Choose carefully who carries in those fake paintings. And feel free to take as much money from this classless art hoarder as you can._

* You may Promote non-Busted Characters for $3k each
* You may Refine the Skills of any non-Busted Character for $2k each
* If you have any unused fake paintings, return them to the supply.

## Chapter 5. The Long Swap

<img class="map-big" src="venetian swap ch 5 the long swap.svg">

_Ok I got tip on a big job. I know this hobbyist art forger who works for the upcoming exhibition. He's been working on the Grapes of Venice painting between shifts. He finished his masterpiece. All we have to do is the switch. He got the piece as close as he could... which is to say not very close. We need to take the fake painting and swap it with the original. As soon as you reach the real painting, I'll detonate some C4 on a nearby wall and you can all escape._

When a character reaches the story beacon, create an exit on this hex and initiate escape phase immediately. This may also be done during the Escape phase.

## Chapter 6. The Redemption Job

<img class="map" src="venetian swap ch 6 the redemption job.svg">

_I've been studying these documents. As it turns out, they belong to the ancestors of the Gallery's curator. He won't let these go. I figure if I turn them in this curator will still pursue extradition on me. If we can return the rightful paintings without a trace we can all call it even. Your objective is to swap in at least three real paintings in for their originals. Sadly, as you would expect, The Gallery has tightened up their security quite a bit given this recent streak of heists. But I'm confident you're up to the task._

_After this, I need to lay low for a while. You should find another source for jobs until I come and find you. Best of luck!_
