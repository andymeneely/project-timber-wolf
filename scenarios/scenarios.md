<div class="title">
  _Your Last Heist:_ <br>
 Learning the Art
</div>

This is main campaign to take you through the world of _Your Last Heist_. The story is broken into three Acts. These are parallel stories that take place over seven days. The Acts are in increasing order of complexity and difficulty. Each Act has a unique narrator and a different suggested starting crew, but they are all part of one story.

Since the stories occur in parallel, you may play the campaigns in parallel as well. This might be useful if you have multiple gaming groups playing the same game. To play these stories in parallel, you will need to unlock the packets of any chapter from a prior act.

The **rebuilding scenarios** may be played at any time, with any crew, have easy objectives and ample loot. Use these scenarios to rebuild your crew after a particularly rough outcome. Play them as often as you like.

Many scenarios also have a **standalone challenge**. These are reasonable conditions under which one could play the chapter directly without going through the entire campaign. Most standalone challenges are no more difficult than the regular campaign conditions, but might require clever gameplay that might not otherwise be easily achievable using the suggested crew compositions.

I hope you enjoy these campaigns! And I hope that you are inspired to make your own heist scenarios. Feel free to share your work over at yourlastheist.com

And, to get started, go ahead and open up the packet for Act I Chapter I.

## Rebuilding Scenarios

_For a friendly neighborhood self-help group, The Forum sure knows how to stay in business. Under the guise of "centering your posture" they prey on the weak-minded in an extortion racket. Lately, they've expanded to using their "charities" as money-laundering fronts, so you know they're loaded up with loot. Don't worry about retribution... we hear they're a non-violent cult._

There's an abandoned warehouse that's used as a secure storage for a variety of stolen goods being moved by this group known as The Forum. Security is pretty intricate on this one. They've got a thermal imaging system called The Watchtower, plus some pressure sensors that makes our life complicated. **Our objective is to steal two jewels,** but if we get the third we get an extra $3k for our next job."_

## Chapter 3. Your Last Heist

_3 days before The Vault Job. Your team is placed in Cell Block B, and you ask around about your "friend". A middle-aged man with an intricate US Marines tattoo on his arm approaches you._

_"Yeah, that guy is The Collector. He's got a bunch of corrupt feds in his pocket and takes sick pleasure in fleecing amateur thieves and getting his... trophies." He looks down at his hands. He has eight fingers._

_"But you... you don't know what you have. You have some real skill. And these feds? They made a huge mistake. They put you all in the same jail cell. Use it. We had some total amateurs break out of here a few days ago and they did it by each getting to a different exit at once. Security is tighter now but I'll help you if you promise me some funding when I get out. God speed."_

_Your team agrees to go their separate ways. **Your objective is to get out of this place, each to a different exit**._

# Act II. The Venetian Swap

## Chapter 1. The Fence

_7 days before The Vault Job. A bunch of apprehensive strangers are summoned by a slender, talkative inmate during lunchtime._

_"Look around. You might see a bunch of lowlife criminals putting in their time, but me? I see a business opportunity. See, I've got a bunch of... connections. I know how to find people who are willing to purchase the world's greatest artwork with no questions asked. I simply lack the means of  acquisition. That's where you all come in. I've hand-picked this team for your talents and potential. First, let's get out of here."_

_"**Our objective is to get me out of this prison**. If some of you don't make it, we can find a replacement but I'd rather not have that happen. Now the only way to pull this off is to have a maximum of two characters at each exit. You may notice that our locksmith friend here is specially equipped to get this party started.

## Chapter 2. The Gallery Job


_6 days until The Vault Job. The Fence gathers your new crew around some blueprints._

_"Our first mark will be our friendly local art gallery. They're expecting a new exhibit of paintings coming in from Venice, Italy tomorrow. Gorgeous collection. Even the museum curators have underappreciated - and undervalued - this collection. Security is pretty lax but, just to be cautious, you cannot have more than two players per entrance to start with. Exit however you want, just make sure you remember those gates close when the alarm goes off."_

_"To make payroll, **I just need three paintings**. Now, you should know that these pieces will sell better if we have them in sets. Both fruit paintings will sell for an extra $2k and all three buildings will get us an extra $4k. We can use any bonus money for the next job."_

_5 days before The Vault Job. You meet The Fence in a diner. He's eating a giant omelet and slides folder of papers across the table to you._

_"Good news! I've got a buyer lined up. Here's the problem. He's a little squeamish about this particular collection. Says he needs documented proof that these are authentic. We're gonna need to acquire those provenance records from deep within the Gallery archives. Security is a little heavier down there - watch out for those pressure sensors and for the new long-range thermal imaging system they call the Watchtower."_

_"**Your objective is to get both documents**. But, it also looks like the archives have a set of jewels awaiting appraisal. If you bring back one jewel, I'll provide $3k. For both, I'll pay you $7k."_

  The Collector
</div>

# Act II. The Venetian Swap

## Chapter 4. The Collector

_4 days before The Vault Job. The Fence calls a meeting at the safe house._

_"Turns out there's a bigger fan of these paintings than me. I have no idea who he hired for the job, but he managed to beat us to the Gallery. He doesn't show up on the provenance, so he clearly didn't acquire these paintings legally. Let's liberate his collection. Plus, we might as well put these fakes to good use."_

_"**Your objective is to swap in at least three painting fakes we have and steal the authentic ones**. Don't steal anything we don't have a fake for. Any swaps beyond the three I'll give an extra $3k. Choose carefully who carries in those fake paintings. And feel free to take as much money from this classless art hoarder as you can."_

_"Hey, while you were in there, I did some poking around this guy's house too. I know him. It's a long story, but suffice to say, he gets special treatment. Get ready because this next job will be your toughest yet. Feel free to bring in a new pro if we can afford it."_

  The Restoration Job
</div>

# Act II. The Venetian Swap

## Chapter 5. The Restoration Job

_3 days before The Vault Job. The crew is chatting about how the prison had another breakout this morning._

_The Fence calls a meeting at the safe house but isn't there. A letter is sitting on a table next to the blueprints of The Gallery._

_"Back along the way I had two friends who were the best in the business. They acquired, I sold. One day we had a customer who was bad news from the start. Tried to keep his money and run off with the goods. We got mixed up, and then it all went down. One of us escaped. I ended up in jail, whole. But my buddy Tat was not so lucky. The Collector took Tat's pinkies with those psycho feds he has on his payroll."_

_"When you were back at the Collector's Estate, I did some poking around his house and came across my buddy's 'trophies'. I knew I found my guy."_

_"It's time for me to come clean with you. I busted you out and groomed you because I was looking for this Collector so we can hit him on the only thing he cares about: his collection."_

_"There's one thing that will drive this guy nuts: to see the real paintings sitting in a museum, so secure he can't afford to get them. The Gallery has had two heists already, and it's about get a third. **Get these paintings back into the museum, in their rightful places**. Unfortunately, security is a bit tighter this time around."_

_"Sorry to disappear on you for this one. I'm working on a bigger play. Once you succeed, stay available and keep those skills honed. Best of luck!"_

  The Demolitions Guy
</div>

# Act III. The Long Con

## Chapter 1: The Demolitions Guy

_5 days before The Vault Job. A short, stocky, grim-faced man meets with some new recruits in his workshop._

_"Nobody ever said this career was easy. You gotta keep moving, keep innovating. Get in, get out, get paid. Don't get greedy. That's what I learned from my last crew, and that is what I intend to teach all of you today."_

_"They say that getting out is hardest part of any heist. Well, that's where I come in. You see, I create exits where there are none. As a result of my abilities, however, marks that would otherwise be too risky for most crews become available. Only thing is... I'm a bit noisy... so just be ready to split when I hit the button."_

_"Ok, now I owe some money and a jewel to this pretentious art fence, so this job is about learning the method. I hear we've got some money stashed over at the old estate. **Our objective is to pick up the jewel and $7k worth of cash.** Anything we pick up beyond that is ours. And I'll promote whoever picks up that jewel."_

# Act III. The Long Con

## Chapter 2: The War Veterans


_4 days before The Vault Job. The Demolitions Guy meets up with the crew in his workshop again. A tall, thin man is joking with him as the group gathers._

_"Great! We're all here. Let me introduce to you an old friend from my platoon. We call him The Fence because he's the only one in the business you'll need to offload your goods. Plus, he's got a great eye for marks."_

_"The mark is this petulant art forger we call Bristle. The Fence here has done plenty of business with him, but it seems Bristle is freelancing without giving proper notice. Let's remind him of common courtesy by blasting a hole in his wall and taking his original._

_We know his studio has both the original and the forgery. None of you will be able to tell which is which, so The Fence is going to have to see the piece up close. He's going in with you and needs to stay with one of you at all times. Don't worry, he won't screw things up."_

_"**Your objective is to steal the one real painting**. The Fence must validate the painting before it can be moved. Once you get it, we breach our way out."_

# Act III. The Long Con

## Chapter 3: Calling the Shots


_3 days before the Vault Job. Your crew is placed in Cell Block C. Guards are everywhere and seem to be on edge. A chatty inmate strikes up a conversation._

_"Yeah, everything has been crazy here. We've had two breakouts just this week. One was this morning. Apparently the secret is to just go out the front doors all at once and nobody knows how to react. "_

_Your team discusses the possibility of escape. Everyone is in and the day is clear: today. This prison clearly has a vulnerability and it isn't fixed yet. You're down a crew member, though, so you reach out for anyone who is available. **Your objective is to get at least one character to break out of prison**._

<div class="page-break"/>

<img class="map" src="tbd map.svg">

### Setup

* You may add one new Character to your crew who has appeared at any time in a prior campaign. Both campaigns have ended by this time in the narrative. You cannot have two members that had the same Amateur class on your crew (_e.g. a Hacktivist and Script Kiddie cannot be on the same Crew_).
  * If the Character ended up Busted, add them to your starting point inside the prison with the rest of the team.

  * The new crew member may obtain new Amateur Skill cards, or keep their original Skill cards if available.
* Events: Use Events 1-21

### Upon Success

_Outside of the prison, chaos reigns. Police are everywhere rounding up inmates who have followed you out. Your crew is about to head into the woods when a beat-up car pulls up. A man in a suit throws open the door and says "Get in!". You decide to take a chance and you all cram into the backseat. The car speeds away into an empty quarry._

_"You don't know me but I know you and I know you're hungry for work. I hear you pulled some jobs with The Demolitions Guy. I have some marks that I need help with."_

_Hanging from his rearview mirror is a keychain with a severed pinky finger. He sees you staring at it. "Don't worry", he said, "this isn't real. But I did do the casting myself! Pretty good, huh?". Your crew exchanges glances._

_"Here's the thing," he continues "you gotta do this my way. I'll be calling the shots on this one."_

* Promote and refine skills of any character who reached an Exit.

_"Okay here's the gig. I've got this pawn shop that is bursting good merchandise. They have these two jewels that would be perfect for my collection. **Your objective is to steal the two jewels**, and anything else you take is yours."_

_"Thing is, with all these prison breakouts lately the owner has put in a special security system that only he can deactivate. Now I know he works late tonight so you need to get in there and take him hostage. I don't know where he'll be, precisely, so you'll have to plan around that."_

# Act III. The Long Con

## Chapter 5: The Bait


_The day before The Vault Job. Your crew reads the letter from The Fence._

_"As I'm sure you've seen, The Collector is not just bad business, he's bad for society. You should also know that his house shows only part of his real collection. The Demo Guy and myself needed locate his collection, so we let ourselves get captured back at The Forgery Studio. He's got a beef with us so we knew he wouldn't risk throwing us in jail. So we got put right next to his vault and got this text message out to the Jeweler."_

_"First, we need you to finish a job we couldn't. Assemble your best crew from all the enemies this scumbag has made. Head over to The Collector's Exhibition Hall and **move the jewel we left behind to the drop site**. Make it look like you dropped it. At the drop site, flip the light switch and the wall will blast open. The Collector will think it was a botched robbery and bring it down to his vault for safekeeping. The jewel is actually an explosive, which we can detonate with your help. Once you're done, head over to the storage containers near The Docks and come rescue us and his collection."_
