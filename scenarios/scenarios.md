# Chapter 3. The Provenance

<img class="map" src="venetian swap ch 3 the archives.svg">

_Good news! I've got a buyer lined up. Here's the problem. He's a little squeamish about this particular collection. Says he needs documented proof that these are authentic. Now, unless one of you is forger, we're gonna need to acquire those provenance records from deep within the Gallery archives. Security is a little heavier down there - watch out for those pressure sensors and for the new long-range camera system they call Watchtower._

_**Your objective is to get both documents**. But, it also looks like the archives also have a set of jewels awaiting appraisal. If you bring back one jewel, I'll provide $3k. For both, I'll pay you $7k._

_Best of luck and don't get greedy._

## Setup

* EVENTS: Use Standard Events 1-21.
* SPECIAL EVENTS: Place two Watchtower Special Events on top of Events 10 and 16.

## Planning Phase

* You may purchase üí° for $1k each of your Team Cash and give it to any Character to start with
* You may purchase üîç for $1k each
* A maximum of two Characters may start on a given Entrance tile
* No maximum on the number of Characters per Exit during Escape

## Upon Success
_Excellent! I think this will be a good relationship. Here's
$6k for team loot, plus payout for extra jewels. At this point I'll let you
promote any non-Busted characters for $3k each and $2k for each Skill._

_Huh. That's funny. These records have some authentication facts about these
paintings. They don't match. We stole some fakes!! Ok let me do some
digging and figure what happened._

Change the painting tokens in your Team Loot to their fake counterparts.

Be sure to record the following on your Campaign ledger:

* Team Cash
* Team Loot
* Character Promotions
* Skill Refinements

# Chapter 4. The Collector

<img class="map" src="venetian swap ch 4 the collector.svg">

_Turns out there's a bigger fan of these paintings than me. I have no idea who he hired for the job, but managed to beat us to the Gallery. He doesn't show up on the provenance, so he clearly didn't acquire these paintings legally. Let's liberate his collection. Plus, we might as well put these fakes to good use._

_**Your objective is to swap in at least three painting fakes we have and steal the authentic ones**. Don't steal anything we don't have a fake for. Any swaps beyond the three I'll give an extra $3k. Choose carefully who carries in those fake paintings. And feel free to take as much money from this classless art hoarder as you can._

## Setup
* EVENTS: Use Standard Events 1-21.
* SPECIAL EVENTS: Place Reinforcements on top of Event 14.

## Planning Phase

* You may Refine Skills for $2k each
* You may Promote Characters for $3k each
* You may purchase üí° for $1k each of your Team Cash and give it to any Character to start with
* You may purchase üîç for $1k each
* A maximum of two Characters may start on a given Entrance tile
* No maximum on the number of Characters per Exit during Escape

## Upon Success
_This crew sure never ceases to impress me. Here's another $6k for your time and an extra $3k for every extra painting swapped out. Go ahead and train up for the next one._

* You may Refine Skills of any non-Busted Character for $2k each
* You may Promote Characters of any non-Busted Character for $3k each
* If you have any unused fake paintings, return them to the supply.

# Chapter 5. The Long Swap

<img class="map-big" src="venetian swap ch 5 the long swap.svg">

_Ok I got tip on a big job. I know this hobbyist art forger who works for the upcoming exhibition. He's been working on the Grapes of Venice painting between shifts. He finished his masterpiece. All we have to do is the switch. He got the piece as close as he could... which is to say not very close. We need to take the fake painting and swap it with the original. As soon as you reach the real painting, I'll detonate some C4 on a nearby wall and you can all escape._

When a character reaches the story beacon, create an exit on this hex and initiate escape phase immediately. This may also be done during the Escape phase.

## Planning Phase

* You may purchase üí° for $1k each of your Team Cash and give it to any Character to start with
* You may purchase üîç for $1k each

## Upon Success
_Fantastic! Here's another $8k for your time. Now that I have done a favor to our forger friend, he's given me some inside information about that Gallery heist a while back. TODO FINISH THIS. Let's prep for the next one._

* You may Refine Skills of any non-Busted Character for $2k each
