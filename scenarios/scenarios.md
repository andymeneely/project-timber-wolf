  _Your Last Heist_ Scenarios
</div>

The following is a collection of scenarios that take you through the world of _Your Last Heist_. The Acts are in increasing order of complexity and difficulty. Each Act has a unique narrator and a different crew, but they are all part of one storyline. The stories occur in parallel, and take place over seven days.

The **rebuilding scenarios** may be played at any time, with any crew, have easy objectives and ample loot. Use these scenarios to rebuild your crew after a particularly rough outcome.

Most scenarios also have a **standalone challenge**. These are reasonable conditions under which one could play the chapter directly without going through the entire campaign. Most standalone challenges are no more difficult than the regular campaign conditions, but might require clever gameplay that might not otherwise be easily achievable using the suggested crew compositions.

## Rebuilding Scenarios

_For a friendly neighborhood self-help group, The Forum sure knows how to stay in business. Under the guise of "centering your posture" they prey on the weak-minded in an extortion and gambling racket. Lately, they've expanded to using their "charities" as money-laundering fronts. They have a few cash filled locations that make for great targets. Don't worry about retribution... we hear they're a non-violent cult._

_3 days before The Vault Job._

<img class="map" src="the fall guys ch 3 cell block c.svg">

_Your team is placed in Cell Block B, and you ask around about your "friend". A middle-aged man with a US Marines tattoo and eight fingers approaches you._

_"Yeah, that guy is The Collector. He's got a bunch of corrupt feds in his pocket and takes sick pleasure in fleecing amateur thieves and getting his... trophies." He looks down at his hands._

_"But you... you don't know what you have. You have some real skill. And these feds? They made one huge mistake. They put you all in the same jail cell. Use it. We had some total amateurs break out of here a few days ago and they did it by each getting to a different exit at once. Security is tighter now but I'll help you out if you promise me some funding when I get out. God speed."_

## Chapter 1. The Fence

_7 days before The Vault Job_

_"Look around. You might see a bunch of lowlife criminals putting in their time, but me? I see a business opportunity. See, I've got a bunch of... connections. I know how to find people who are willing to purchase the world's greatest artwork with no questions asked. I simply lack the means of... acquisition. That's where you all come in. I've hand-picked this team for your talents and potential. First, let's get out of here."_

_"**Our objective is to get me out of here**. If some of you don't make it, we can find a replacement but I'd rather not have that happen. Now the only way to pull this off is to have a maximum of two characters at each exit. You may notice that our locksmith friend here is specially equipped to get this party started. But first, let's do a little recon."_

# The Venetian Swap

## Chapter 2. The Gallery Job

<img class="map" src="venetian swap ch 2 the gallery.svg">

_Our first mark will be our friendly local art gallery. They're expecting a new exhibit of paintings coming in from Venice, Italy tomorrow. Gorgeous collection. Even the museum curators have underappreciated - and undervalued - this collection. Security is pretty lax but, just to be cautious, you cannot have more than two players per entrance to start with. Exit however you want, just make sure you remember those gates close when the alarm goes off._

_To make payroll, I just need three paintings. Now, you should know that these pieces will sell better if we have them in sets. Both fruit paintings will sell for an extra $2k and all three buildings will get us an extra $4k. We can use any bonus money for the next job._

_Good luck and don't forget: getting in is the easy
part._

### Setup

* EVENTS: Use Events 1-21
* SPECIAL EVENTS: Place Reinforcements on top of Event 14

One of you who actually stole a painting this heist is eligible. I'll let the team decide who gets this promotion._

# The Venetian Swap

## Chapter 3. The Provenance

<img class="map" src="venetian swap ch 3 the archives.svg">

_Good news! I've got a buyer lined up. Here's the problem. He's a little squeamish about this particular collection. Says he needs documented proof that these are authentic. Now, unless one of you is forger, we're gonna need to acquire those provenance records from deep within the Gallery archives. Security is a little heavier down there - watch out for those pressure sensors and for the new long-range camera system they call Watchtower._

_**Your objective is to get both documents**. But, it also looks like the archives also have a set of jewels awaiting appraisal. If you bring back one jewel, I'll provide $3k. For both, I'll pay you $7k._

_Excellent! I think this will be a good relationship. Here's
$4k for team loot, plus payout for extra jewels. At this point I'd be willing to support some "professional development"._

_Huh. That's funny. These provenance records have some authentication facts about these paintings. They don't match the pieces we have. We stole some fakes!! Ok let me do some digging and figure what happened._

* Add $4k to your Team Cash, plus $3k/$7k if you stole 1/2 jewels.
* You may Promote non-Busted Characters for $3k each
* You may Refine the Skills of any non-Busted Character for $2k each

# The Venetian Swap

## Chapter 4. The Collector

<img class="map" src="venetian swap ch 4 the collector.svg">

_Turns out there's a bigger fan of these paintings than me. I have no idea who he hired for the job, but managed to beat us to the Gallery. He doesn't show up on the provenance, so he clearly didn't acquire these paintings legally. Let's liberate his collection. Plus, we might as well put these fakes to good use._

_**Your objective is to swap in at least three painting fakes we have and steal the authentic ones**. Don't steal anything we don't have a fake for. Any swaps beyond the three I'll give an extra $3k. Choose carefully who carries in those fake paintings. And feel free to take as much money from this classless art hoarder as you can._

* You may Refine the Skills of any non-Busted Character for $2k each
* If you have any unused fake paintings, return them to the supply.

# The Venetian Swap

## Chapter 5. The Restoration Job

<img class="map" src="venetian swap ch 6 the redemption job.svg">

REDO THIS. NEED A BETTER REASON. Bounty on our heads? The Collector knows? "I've made a deal with the Gallery's curator to get these back, no questions asked in exchange for a bigger play."

_I've been studying these documents. As it turns out, they belong to the ancestors of the Gallery's curator. He won't let these go. I figure if I turn them in this curator will still pursue extradition on me. If we can return the rightful paintings without a trace we can all call it even. Your objective is to swap in at least three real paintings in for their originals. Sadly, as you would expect, The Gallery has tightened up their security quite a bit given this recent streak of heists. But I'm confident you're up to the task._

_After this, I need to lay low for a while. You should find another source for jobs until I come and find you. Best of luck!_


### Setup

* EVENTS: Use Events 1-20, then Event 20a, 20b, and 20c, then 21.

# The Long Con

## Chapter 1: The Demolitions Guy

<img class="map" src="the smugglers ch 1 the estate.svg">

_Nobody ever said this career was easy. You gotta keep moving, keep innovating. Get in, get out, get paid. Don't get greedy. That's what I learned from my last crew, and that is what I intend to teach all of you today._

_They say that getting out is hardest part of any heist. Well, that's where I come in. You see... I create exits where there are none. As a result of my abilities, however, marks that would otherwise be too risky for most crews become available. Only thing is... I'm a bit noisy... so just be ready to split when I hit the button._

_Ok, now I owe some money and a jewel to this pretentious art fence, so this job is about learning the method. I hear we've got some money stashed over at the old estate. Our objective is to pick up the jewel and $7k worth of cash. Anything we pick up beyond that is ours. And I'll promote whoever picks up that jewel._

## Setup

REDO ALL THIS

<img class="map" src="the smugglers ch 5 the castle.svg">

_Story is going to be about getting into a castle and we can only get in through a secret entrance in the courtyard_

_Ok let's put this method to work. I've got this tip that this jeweler keeps his personal stash all in one place in the center of his house. Sure, it's surrounded completely with guards and lockdown gates designed to trap a bunch of amateurs. But he won't expect our escape plan._

_I also happen to know that our jeweler will be in tonight and he is a bit of a pushover. If we want, we can use him to get the goods. We just can't let him out of our sight until that alarm goes off. My only warning is this: whenever you're dealing with hostages, remember that they do have a breaking point._

_**Our objective is to steal two jewels.** A third jewel is worth $4k. Any of the cash goes toward this team and helps us train up for the next big job._

### Setup

_Ok I got tip on a big job. I know this hobbyist art forger who works for the upcoming exhibition. He's been working on the Grapes of Venice painting between shifts. He finished his masterpiece. All we have to do is the switch. He got the piece as close as he could... which is to say not very close. We need to take the fake painting and swap it with the original. As soon as you reach the real painting, I'll detonate some C4 on a nearby wall and you can all escape._
