Masters of the Heist is a cooperative game for the tabletop. You are a uniquely skilled career criminal who pulls meticulously-planned heists with your crew. The only question is: are you in over your head?

The game features interlocking hex tiles that can build thousands of different scenarios. For the first part (~15 minutes) the team plans how they will execute their heist. Then, they put the plan into action... but nothing ever goes perfectly to plan (~45-60min).

Characters use Ideas as their currency to modify die rolls. They deal with Locks, Guards, Cameras, and all kinds of other security. They must minimize Noise or increasingly dire Crises will come up. And then Escape... well let's hope you kept enough Ideas for that.

Heists can succeed but characters can get busted. The team will have to bust out their teammates if they want to keep the character, or simply bring in a new character. Everyone levels up at the end of every heist. The Burglar will have to decide to become a Grease Man or a Ghost Runner, for example.

Masters is a sandbox campaign game, where scenarios are labelled with their difficulty and adapts to different player counts. Each scenario unlocks a new Fixer. I have sketches for more a story-driven, serialized version, and some initial sketches for a legacy version.

90 minutes. 1-4 players. Solo and two-player variants have a few additional rules. 5 players is being playtested. Complexity is similar to Castles of Burgundy, much less complex than Gloomhaven and a little bit more complex than Burgle Bros.

There are 8 different types of Amateur characters: Thug, Script Kiddie, Street Urchin, Burglar, Shutter Bug, Lookout, Angry Locksmith, and Pickpocket. Each of those can level up into one of two Pro characters each.

If Ocean's 11, Money Heist, The Italian Job, Inside Man, and The Sting were made into a board game... this would be it.

Much of the design and prototyping work has been done under an MIT open source license, but I am willing to convert to proprietary if needed. This project has not been widely publicized - the website and scenario designer was for me to practice my web development skills. Ravensburger is the first publisher I am contacting.
