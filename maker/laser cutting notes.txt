To cut on our Full Spectrum Laser (look up the specs...)
1/8" baltic birch (provide link)

Cut: 60% power and 100% speed
Engrave: 0.25%power and 100% speed

I did have some trouble with the focal length and adjusting for the curvature of the wood, so some of my engraving cuts are a bit wide.

Had some issues with the "+" in the corner. It should really be an "L". Registration was tough, but you just have to be careful about it.

I wanted to add a text marker on the Pressure Sensors so we don't have to rely upon color.

The text on the back of the paintings is too small for the kerf of the laser

The box should have the title of the game on the side

The interlocking tiles are hard to put together and have some sharp edges that will break over time. Work on a different interlocking mechanism.

Don't put things side-to-side. The laser will go over some already-cut pieces and you'll get a nasty black char stain on it. Just put every piece in its own sprue.

To maximize the materials, it might be better to just go with 11x11 size. The 9x11 limitation is really just my own, but that's not even really a limitation. 11x11 is standard anyway.

On that note, once we maximize to 11x11 we can make the tiles bigger. It would be great if the tiles were maybe 20-30% bigger. 

Can we do the cards this way too? Text is quite readable if we get this laser kerf right.

Maybe start using single-line fonts for anything with text so that it engraves a bit nicer.
