On the next laser cut, I need to:

* Cut acrylic top
* Cut vault box sides
* Cut hole+spacers+box teeth+gears
* Cut binder cover
* Cut front-back components: documents, dotted-dog, new dog tokens, lockdown gates, noise tracker, pressure sensors, artwork, villain movement tokens
* Cut hex planning tokens
* Cut interlocking tiles (not front-to-back)

After this cut, let's stabilize for making this from scratch.
