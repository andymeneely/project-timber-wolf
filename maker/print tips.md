# Printing Scenarios & Rules

For my Brother Color Laser printer (HL-3170CDW)

* I like to print this out double-sided on regular 8.5x11 paper, then cut it down.
* My printer driver doesn't center things in the page when the document size doesn't match the paper size. Yours might be different, but it's a really frustrating problem. SO, here's my solution. Microsoft Edge is the only browser that I can find (none of the others unfortunately) that will center each page for duplex printing. So you can just print them out, cut them down to size, and hole-punch from there.

Solutions that I've tested that don't work:
* SumatraPDF - just delegates to my Brother driver
* Chrome - not enough options, doesn't center it, and doesn't *actually* do two-sided printing if you tell it to.

Microsoft Edge Options:
* Portrait
* Duplex printing: Long Edge (Automatic)
* Paper size: Letter
* Output quality: high quality
* Color mode: color
* Document binding: left edge
