# v16.0 / 2017-08-18

## Rules changes

* Players can no longer pass.
* Events are dealt after each round so that the game always advances each round.
* Lots of overall revisions and clarity of the rules, particularly with respect to Noise and Events.

## Scenario changes

none

## Balance changes

* Skills re-balanced to lower the number of no-noise actions, particularly fewer Study actions.

## Things you will need to re-print

* Skill cards
* Event cards
* Rules

* NPC cards

## Known issues

* Haven't finished porting the new (slightly more forgiving) noise tracker from Maker to base. Use that one if you can.
* The iconography on the Events is currently wrong in many places. Go with the text.
* Some cards are rendered differently on Travis (yay font rendering inconsistencies!) and got ellipsized.
