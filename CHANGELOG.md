# v17.0 / Unreleased

## Components impacted

If upgrading from v16.x, you will need to update the following components:

* Characters: Street Urchin, Grifter, Script Kiddie, Black Hat, Hacktivist
* Update the entire scenario guide - small tweaks throughout

## Gameplay changes

Some changes to character default actions:

Reworked Street Urchin et al.
* This whole class gains "CHANGE IN PLANS" and "ALRIGHT, NEW PLAN", which allows you to change planning tokens once per heist
* Street urchin can't hesitate anymore - now REPORTs, as with Mastermind
* Grifter doesn't Study anymore - DEDUCEs
* Mastermind loses INSPIRE, gains ALRIGH, NEW PLAN which is like one-time inspire as well as a CHANGE IN PLAN. 
* Mastermind can now Walk and Run, because run-only stinks.

Reworked Script Kiddie et al.
* Gains new Once-per-heist: AOE reveal on a known camera.
* Hacktivist rw gets STRIDE in addition to the RUN option

## Scenario changes

* Guard Dogs are added properly to Act 2 Chapter 4
* New map! Act 3 Chapter 3 "Calling the Shots"
* Added timeline keys on each cover page
* Various tweakings of writing, of course.

# v16.1 / 2017-08-18

* Bugfix in the build. v16.0 build failed.

# v16.0 / 2017-08-18

## Rules changes

* Players can no longer pass.
* Events are dealt after each round so that the game always advances each round.
* Lots of overall revisions and clarity of the rules, particularly with respect to Noise and Events.

## Scenario changes

none

## Balance changes

* Skills re-balanced to lower the number of no-noise actions, particularly fewer Study actions.
* Events, to account for the new rule, generally output fewer Alerts.

## Things you will need to re-print

* Skill cards
* Event cards
* Rules

* NPC cards

## Known issues

* Haven't finished porting the new (slightly more forgiving) noise tracker from Maker to base. Use that one if you can.
* The iconography on the Events is currently wrong in many places. Go with the text.
* Some cards are rendered differently on Travis (yay font rendering inconsistencies!) and got ellipsized.

# v0.15

* Started keeping a changelog
