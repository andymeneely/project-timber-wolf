Back when I was Angry Locksmith, I could never keep quiet.

Every turn I took made noise.

Punch a guard? Noise.

Unplug a camera? Noise.

And boy was my team getting into trouble.

We had alerts going up from all the guards we subdued.

We had gates closing.

We even reinforcements come in and block our exit.

Then, I had an idea.

What if I take care of the locks and build up my ideas for escape?

Meanwhile, our Street Urchin can dash ahead to get the goods.

That could work.

And it did. We got the artwork we needed, the payout we needed, and most importantly.

We got out.

And you know what? I have no regrets.

Because you know what they say...

You're only as good as Your Last Heist.
