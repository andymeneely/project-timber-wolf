Back when I was Angry Locksmith, I thought I knew it all.

Just Smash 'n' Grab and call it a day.

But I never realized how everything did made noise.

Punch a guard? Noise.

Unplug a camera? Noise.

Before I knew it, we had alerts going up from all the guards we subdued.

A gate closed and we lost our Burglar.

We even reinforcements come in and block my exit.

Then, I had an idea.

What if I take care of the locks study the room to get escape ideas?

Meanwhile, our Street Urchin can dash ahead to get the goods.

That could work.

And it did. We got the artwork we needed, the payout we needed, and most importantly.

I got out.

And you know what? I have no regrets.

Because you know what they say...

You're only as good as Your Last Heist.
