For file size reasons, I'm saving the original Gimp file in my Dropbox. But, here's how I reproduced it in case I lose that.

* Get the "Grunge Forest" by Asunder on Deviant Art. It's a grunge texture: http://asunderstock.deviantart.com/art/Grunge-Forest-67826499
* Get one of my cookie sheet images that has good cuts in it (e.g. IMG_1169.jpg)
* Grunge Forest layer gets set to Overlay, and it's on top.
* Cookie sheet layer is set to Soft Light
* The orangey-red is #b32c06
* The purple is #692376
* A green and a brown also work well. The brown kinda looks like the Hamilton background, and too goldy-ish. But maybe that could be for level 3 skills/characters (e.g. Legendary).
