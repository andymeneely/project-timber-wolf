# The Game

_Your Last Heist_ is a cooperative, multi-stage heist game. Each player is playing the role of a criminal and you must work as a team to do traverse the building and steal items, all while dealing with obstacles like closing gates, guards, locks, cameras.

The game has two modes:
  * Standard: Pull 3 heists.
  * Campaign: Pull 9 heists. See the end of this instructions for campaign instructions

During each heist, players will collaborate during a simultaneous action phase to coordinate their movements to minimize risk and maximize loot.

(how we set up an individual heist)



**If this is your first game**, we recommend skipping the "Character Building" phase and using the following characters and skills:

  * Street Urchin with and Improvise and Hurry
  * Angry Locksmith with Self-Defense and Hurry
  * Thug with Smash 'n' Grab and Break 'n' Enter
  * Lookout with Self-Defense and Tinker

# Gameplay

The game is structured in a series of small heists with increasing difficulty. The structure of each heist is in three parts:

  1. The Plan
    * Plot movement
    * Purchase extra Reveals 🔍
    * Purchase extra Ideas 💡
  2. The Heist
    1. Roll for Skill
    2. Character Actions
    3. Roll for Security
    4. Escape Phase
  3. Level Up
    * Level up Skills
    * Level up Characters

## Part 1: The Plan

## Part 2: The Heist

### Roll for Skill

Players roll the die according to the color of their player.

### Character Action

In this phase, each player uses their die to execution one action. Each player has four options for their action: two actions from the Character and one action from each Skill . *For example, the Angry Locksmith may always take PICK🔓 or WALK🔊➜ regardless of what he rolled. Suppose he has the Self-Defense and Hurry skills, and he rolled a 1, then he may take either STUDY💡💡 or RUN🔊🔊➜➜ as his action.*

During this time, players are working collaboratively and simultaneously. (That is, they are *not* taking turns!) Players decide which action to take, and how to execute their sub-actions. *For example, a player may choose to take the PUNCH 👊🔊🔊➜ action, which has sub-actions of Subdue(👊), 2 Noises(🔊🔊), and Move(➜).*

Players may execute their sub-actions in any order. Players may interleave their actions with the actions of other players.

*For example, Kelly takes REVEAL🔍 and reveals a guard one space away from Tim. Tim, with this new information, then chooses to take PUNCH👊🔊🔊➜, and does a ➜ then a 👊 on the newly-discovered guard, then increases the 🔊 by 2.*

The Noise(🔊) sub-action is **required**, but all other sub-actions are not required. *For example, you not need to unlock two locks to take Rake🔓🔓🔊➜, but it costs you a 🔊 regardless.*

Each player has the final say about what to do with their own character.

Players may use any number of their Ideas💡 to modify the die roll by 1. Players may "wrap around", that is, spend an 💡 to go from a 6 to a 1.

Players may opt to simply PASS on their turn, and take no actions and not increase noise.

When a player has finished their action, they place their die on the action they have taken to indicate they are finished (i.e. on the square on the character card or the square on the appropriate skill card).

### Roll for Security

When all players have finished their actions, they place their die on the skill they have taken to indicate they are finished. When all players are finished, one player must roll the four-sided security die. (The number on the bottom is the number that is rolled)

The event the occurs is the one counted from the alert bar.

### The Escape Phase

When the Security Roll reaches the alarm, all gates close. When a gate is closed, remove the tile from the board. All players who are standing on a Gate are Busted.

Then, each player who has not reached an exit determines if they can reach it. Determine the shortest path from the player to the exit. Ignore planned tiles for your character. Locked tiles are impassable. Exiting an Unsubdued Guard costs two moves(➜➜). Cameras have no effect during the escape phase.

Each leftover 💡 that a character has may be used for 1 move➜ toward an exit.

If a player is still in the building after using up all 💡 to move toward an exit, they may roll their skill die. The number shown on the die is equal to the number of moves they may use to exit. If they still cannot exit, they are Busted.

*For example .*

Players may NOT use skills that cost 🔊 or ⚠ during this phase. *For example, SEWER CRAWL is not allowed during Escape, but GREAT IN A PINCH is allowed*.
