# The Game

_Your Last Heist_ is a cooperative, multi-stage heist game. You are playing the role of a uniquely skilled criminal. You must work with other skilled criminals to quietly traverse the building and steal items, all while dealing with obstacles like closing gates, guards, locks, and cameras. The game has two modes:
  * Standard: Pull 3 heists. Playable in 60-90 minutes.
  * Campaign: Pull 9 heists. See the _The Campaign_ section for instructions

During each heist, you will collaborate with teammates during a simultaneous action phase to coordinate your movements. You will begin each turn by rolling a die to determine which actions are available to you. You use Ideas💡 to modify that die roll, too. But don't spend too many - you'll need those Ideas💡 to escape, too!

## The Characters

<img src="./character_example.png" width="300" align="right">

The game comes with 18 unique characters, each with special skills and stats. Each card has:

  * ① **Level.** There are 6 level 1 characters and 12 level 2 characters.
  * ②	**Planning Memory.** This is the number of hexes your character may move through during a heist. Some characters have more mobility than others.
  * ③	**Initial Ideas**. The number of Ideas💡 you start with at the beginning of each heist.
  * ④	**Default Actions**. These are Actions that are available regardless of your die roll.
  * ⑤	**Special Ability**. These are attributes or abilities that your character can uniquely do.
  * ⑥ **Place for Skills**. You will be placing a Skill card in each of these locations, which will provide additional actions.

Between Heists, your team will get a chance to level up some of your characters. Each character is given two choices to level into, as indicated on the back of their card.

## The Skills

Each character has two Skills. The game has 6 level 1 and 12 level 2 Skills.

Each Skill has six Actions that correspond to a die roll.

Between Heists, your team will get a chance to level up some of your skills. Each Skill, like characters, can Level Up to one of two Skills. There are two copies of each skill in the deck.

A Skill card defines six Actions, each corresponding to a die roll. In the Roll for Skill phase of the heist, your die roll will determine which Actions are available to your for that turn.

## The Board

The board is a set of modular double-sided hex tiles. Each tile is Blank on one side, and is a Security tile on the other side. The instructions for setting up each board can be found in The Configurations

# The Set-Up

(how we set up an individual heist)



**If this is your first game**, we recommend skipping the "Character Building" phase and using the following characters and skills:

  * Street Urchin with Improvise and Hurry
  * Angry Locksmith with Self-Defense and Hurry
  * Thug with Smash 'n' Grab and Break 'n' Enter
  * Lookout with Self-Defense and Tinker

# Gameplay

The game is structured in a series of small heists with increasing difficulty. The structure of each heist is:

  1. The Plan
    * Plot movement
    * Purchase extra Reveals 🔍
    * Purchase extra Ideas 💡
  2. The Heist
    1. Roll for Skill
    2. Character Actions
    3. Roll for Security
    4. Escape Phase
  3. Level Up
    * Level up Skills
    * Level up Characters

## Part 1: The Plan

This is your opportunity to come up with a rough plan of how you will pull this Heist. Every time you do a Move➜, you must move onto a hex that you have Planned. Thus, mark off every hex tile that you will be allowed to move on by placing a Plan token of your color on the hex tiles you (may or may not) move onto.

Players may purchase any number of Reveal🔍 for $1k of team loot each.

Players may purchase any number of Ideas💡 for $1k of team loot each. Place each Idea💡 on a character immediately.

## Part 2: The Heist

### Roll for Skill

Players roll the die according to the color of their player.

### Character Action

In this phase, each player uses their die to execution one action. Each player has four options for their action: two actions from the Character and one action from each Skill . *For example, the Angry Locksmith may always take PICK🔓 or WALK🔊➜ regardless of what he rolled. Suppose he has the Self-Defense and Hurry skills, and he rolled a 1, then he may take either STUDY💡💡 or RUN🔊🔊➜➜ as his action.*

During this time, players are working collaboratively and simultaneously. (That is, they are *not* taking turns!) Players decide which action to take, and how to execute their sub-actions. *For example, a player may choose to take the PUNCH 👊🔊🔊➜ action, which has sub-actions of Subdue(👊), 2 Noises(🔊🔊), and Move(➜).*

Players may execute their sub-actions in any order.

*For example, Kelly takes REVEAL🔍 and reveals a guard one space away from Tim. Tim, with this new information, then chooses to take PUNCH👊🔊🔊➜, and does a ➜ then a 👊 on the newly-discovered guard, then increases the 🔊 by 2.*

Players may interleave their sub-actions with the sub-actions of other players. (Note: doing this effectively take teamwork and is the key to victory!)

*For example, Jacob takes SNEAK🔍➜➜ and Derek takes PICK🔓.*

The Noise(🔊) sub-action is **required**, but all other sub-actions are not required. *For example, you not need to unlock two locks to take Rake🔓🔓🔊➜, but it costs you a 🔊 regardless.*

Each player has the final say about what to do with their own character.

Players may use any number of their Ideas💡 to modify the die roll by 1. Players may "wrap around", that is, spend an 💡 to go from a 6 to a 1.

Players may opt to simply PASS on their turn, and take no actions and not increase noise.

When a player has finished their action, they place their die on the action they have taken to indicate they are finished (i.e. on the square on the character card or the square on the appropriate skill card).

### Roll for Security

When all players have finished their actions, they place their die on the skill they have taken to indicate they are finished. When all players are finished, one player must roll the four-sided security die. (The number on the bottom is the number that is rolled)

The event the occurs is the one counted from the alert bar.

### The Escape Phase

When the Security Roll reaches the alarm, all gates close. When a gate is closed, remove the tile from the board. All players who are standing on a Gate are Busted.

Then, each player who has not reached an exit determines if they can reach it. Determine the shortest path from the player to the exit. Ignore planned tiles for your character. Locked tiles are impassable. Exiting an Unsubdued Guard costs two moves(➜➜). Cameras have no effect during the escape phase.

Each leftover 💡 that a character has may be used for 1 move➜ toward an exit.

If a player is still in the building after using up all 💡 to move toward an exit, they may roll their skill die. The number shown on the die is equal to the number of moves they may use to exit. If they still cannot exit, they are Busted.

*For example (write an example here).*

Players may NOT use skills that cost 🔊 or ⚠ during this phase. *For example, SEWER CRAWL is not allowed during Escape, but GREAT IN A PINCH is allowed*.

# The Campaign

In Campaign mode, all of the rules apply the same way, with the following exceptions:
  * Play 3 level 1 Boards, then 3 Level 2 Boards, then 3 Level 3 Boards.
  * After each Heist, one non-Busted player may level up 1 Skill.
  * After each even-numbered heist, one non-Busted player may level up a Character.

We also recommend the following campaigns:
  * **The Art of the Heist**. In order, the boards are:
  * **The Vault Job**

# The Legacy

The final heist of any Standard or Campaign game does not need any extra loot. However, as a measure of your team's effectiveness for all of time, we ask that you record your loot. Because, after all, you're only as good as Your Last Heist!
