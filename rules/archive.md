Here are rules that I wrote but are on the backburner.

## Bosses

Some scenarios have a Boss. A Boss is not an NPC, rather, it is an uncontrollable security system that your team must react to. Bosses are represented by the black pawn and a card given by the scenario.

Bosses have Waypoint tokens. The Boss pawn starts at the Waypoint marked 1. Before each Roll for Skill phase, the Boss moves one tile directly toward the next Waypoint. If a Boss reaches the end of the Waypoints, they reverse their direction and go back through the waypoints.

A Boss **encounters** something (e.g. a subdued guard) if he shares a tile with that thing as a result of a move.

Bosses do not traverse non-tiled gaps. Bosses ignore locks, guards, cameras, and any other security system. If a Boss is on a lockdown gate when it closes, first move them forward on their path until they are off of the gate before it closes. Waypoints are not movable unless otherwise specified.

Bosses also have a Suspicion(⁉) tracker. The card will define what causes a Boss's Suspicion(⁉) to be raised, and what happens at each level with a Suspicion Action. If the tracker says "immediately", then the action is done once, when the Suspicion(⁉) was first raised to that level. Otherwise, the action is done each round.

<div class="example">
*For example, "Release 1 Dog immmediately for Supsicion Level 1" means you release only 1 Dog, when Level 1 is first reached and not on subsequent rounds.*
</div>

Place the Suspicion token on the starting place on the Boss tracker during planning. When suspicion reaches its maximum level, repeat the highest Suspicion Action.

All other instructions for individual bosses are on their given cards.
